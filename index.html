            <p> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that contains the biological instructions that make each species unique. 
                DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce. 
                DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. 
                These building blocks are made of 4 parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, a <strong>rakia group</strong> and one of four types of nitrogen bases. </p>

            <p> In the Balkans, the biggest DNA part scientifically proven is the <strong>rakia group</strong>. 
                Well, that explains a lot of things. 
                One of them is that rakia is considered to be the national drink of the vast majority of Balkan nations. Logically right? </p>

            <p>  With that being cleared, let's go back to our plan with the recipes. Rakia is a very complex drink that allows to be consumed along with many different types of meze from salads to dried meat.
                It should be noted that choosing the right meze to pair rakia with is <strong> crucial </strong>. 
                Serving the rakia with the wrong meze could absolutely destroy the experience of the person who wanted to enjoy the "slayer of kings".</p>
       
           <p> To help you with that, these are our perfect meze recipes: </p>
