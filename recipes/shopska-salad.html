        <p> When making this salad, make sure that your tomatoes are juicy because that is what makes this salad so amazing. 
            We don't add fancy salad dressings. It's oil and vinegar. 
            But you don't need anything else because all the flavors blend so well together. It's like a flavor explosion! </p>
